## How to play

> In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive sets.

In my game, left clicking or tapping will toggle the mark type in the order: origin -> fill(check this block) -> cross(ignore this block) -> origin. _*In addition, right clicking will trigger the reverse order.*_

Fill your puzzle and submit it, the page will show whether your result is correct.
